Watch it on my Facebook page or @RZIMhq’s YouTube channel: http://youtu.be/qI56D7KvOUc #SeeingJesusFromTheEast	Our God is a just God and a loving God. As Christians, we must recognize how important the place of justice and grace and mercy in their combining impact need to be. @JusticeReform #SecondChanceMonth	An apt quote to remember during #SecondChanceMonth	I wish so much that Chuck Colson were alive today, but his legacy goes on through @prisonfellowshp and @JusticeReform. Grateful for initiatives such as #SecondChanceMonth that bring hope and shine light on one of the most vulnerable and forgotten populations in our society.	I commend the memory of Chuck Colson, one of my dearest friends in years gone by. I think of him often, and his passing was a great loss. His heartbeat for prisoners, having been through prison himself, was one of the brightest spots that ever emerged from the Watergate era...	“This book will enrich your life, deepen your faith, and encourage your soul!” —@LeeStrobel #SeeingJesusFromTheEast	Only God could have put this team together, and I believe that more than ever as I see all He is enabling them to do and to minister in a time such as this. // We don't take your prayers and support for granted. Please continue to stand with us. We need you more than ever.	The amazing thing about the gospel of Jesus Christ is that it is a story that invites tests for truth. Everything he said and taught was open to historical investigation and was incredibly supported by prophecies and by his works. #SeeingJesusFromTheEast: https://seeingjesusfromtheeast.com/",392302.0,3048.0,128.70800524934384,210.125,3.0,514.0,47.125,2.0,141.0,#SeeingJesusFromTheEast #SecondChanceMonth #SecondChanceMonth #SecondChanceMonth #SeeingJesusFromTheEast #SeeingJesusFromTheEast,0.75,0.5,20.227261904761665,281,3

I suppose it’s being extra conscious of others’ feelings and internalizing them. IMO, that’s a legitimate psychiatric phenomenon.

Method that’s based on breaking down complex forms into shapes, like a cone and a sphere for a horse’s head, for example.

250,chrishemsworth,"Making this film was one of the most exhausting but rewarding experiences I’ve ever had. We set out to make the most insane, intense action film and I’m beyond proud of what we’ve achieved. Thankful to everyone involved in making this film possible. It’s out tomorrow on @netflix!	Persistence pays off - not only did this guy get an autograph, he also does all my motorbike stunts from now on.	Quite happy to let the completely insane experts handle this particular shot! Our stunt team risked their lives and pushed their bodies to get some of these shots, and it’s truly incredible to see. The movie wouldn’t have been possible without these guys 	I decided to scrap this move from the fight sequence in extraction. Partly because I couldn’t pull it off but mostly because it was pretty pointless in a fight. Plus @BobbyHanton’s a show off.	Proud to help @SwisseAU put out this message to all of our healthcare heroes on the frontlines fighting to keep us all healthy: THANK YOU for your service and sacrifice. We are so grateful for your work.	By far the most complicated action sequence I’ve ever been part of, and if it wasn’t already complex enough, our director decided to shoot it as a “oner” — almost 12 minutes long and it’s about as exhausting to watch as it was to film. Strap in folks!	So happy to finally be able to share the trailer for EXTRACTION with you all! This has been a difficult few months for all of us, and we hope this will provide a bit of entertainment while we are all staying home. April 24th on @NETFLIX.

327,Kasparov63,"""Hell, if I could explain it to the average person, it wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize.""—Richard Feynman. Quoted in People Magazine, 22 July 1985.	There is time and room for both, but the early signs of how easily Trump dominates the media just like 2016 are not promising. It's not enough to condemn, people must also see the valid alternative. ""Anyone but Trump"" is a slogan, not a turnout strategy in swing states.	We are not ready.	If you didn't realize Trump was unfit for office before he talked about injecting disinfectant, you'll never know or care. Instead, talk about what a fit US president would do, beginning with caring about human life.	Six months remain to discuss plans to return to reality, to sanity, to boring competence. The dopamine blast of bashing Trump is dangerously addictive. It helps make him the center of everything, which is his only chance in November.	If 2020 is seen purely as a verdict on Trump, he has a chance despite his impeachment and catastrophic mishandling of Covid-19, due to extreme polarization and the electoral college.	It's well and good to document and expose Trump's dangerous incompetence, but it's still absorbed into the 24/7 Trump news cycle. Equal or more attention must go to the competent & sane alternative.	Trump always eager to collaborate with Putin despite Pentagon protest. Unlike 75 years ago, there is no shared struggle between the US and Russia now. Unless it is by all our citizens against these mafia bosses!	Dictatorships love big sporting spectacles, from the Olympic Games to the World Cup. Clean the money, the image, export corruption. They don't liberalize, they are emboldened by the approval.	There are consequences to such deals with the devil. Putin's sense of ownership in England led to murders in London & Salisbury that could have been mass fatality events. And we know the Saudis aren't afraid of blood either.",540835.0,531.0,1018.5216572504708,560.4,55.0,1987.0,171.7,7.0,855.0,,0.0,0.0,2.343827160493611,321,3
