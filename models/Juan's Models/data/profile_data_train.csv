This is a great introduction to computer science concepts for students at all levels. I’m looking forward to joining today’s Code Break.	Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them.

On #WorldHealthDay — and every day — I want to thank all of the health heroes for their sacrifices and for keeping us safe.

If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work.

May the Lord comfort and be with you all in Jesus name, amen.	On the cross, Jesus took on the punishment and shame for all our sins. Today, we honour his sacrifice and recognize the power made available through his resurrection. Happy Easter everyone! Nigeria will prevail.	There are many concerns associated with the lockdown. We are concerned about how the economy will remain stable, how jobs can be protected and ways to create new jobs where possible. We believe that together, Nigeria will prevail!	Many of our citizens are daily wage workers and the President has expressed concerns about this. We are now thinking of ways to provide succour for the period they are unable to work.	I met with President @Mbuhari today to update him on the progress of the Economic Sustainability Committee which he directed me to chair. We have held a number of meetings and are receiving sectoral suggestions on how to position the Nigerian economy post COVID-19.	This afternoon, I chaired the NEC Special Committee on COVID-19. The meeting with 7 State Governors and the Finance Minister focused on the urgent economic solutions that will be beneficial to Nigerians through this pandemic. I believe that Nigeria will prevail!

Dolapo and I express our sympathies to the President, Mrs Kulu Kyari, the children, and members of the family on the passing of Mallam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to the President. May the Lord comfort and be with you all in Jesus name, amen.	On the cross, Jesus took on the punishment and shame for all our sins. Today, we honour his sacrifice and recognize the power made available through his resurrection. Happy Easter everyone! Nigeria will prevail.	There are many concerns associated with the lockdown. We are concerned about how the economy will remain stable, how jobs can be protected and ways to create new jobs where possible. We believe that together, Nigeria will prevail!	Many of our citizens are daily wage workers and the President has expressed concerns about this. We are now thinking of ways to provide succour for the period they are unable to work.	I met with President @Mbuhari today to update him on the progress of the Economic Sustainability Committee which he directed me to chair. We have held a number of meetings and are receiving sectoral suggestions on how to position the Nigerian economy post COVID-19.	This afternoon, I chaired the NEC Special Committee on COVID-19. The meeting with 7 State Governors and the Finance Minister focused on the urgent economic solutions that will be beneficial to Nigerians through this pandemic. I believe that Nigeria will prevail!

160,BarackObama,"In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.	This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all.	If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs.	While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late.	We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level.	Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.)	Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other––as neighbors and as citizens.	When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time.	Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises.	For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at http://JoeBiden.com.

If a pitcher had a late breaking tight slider I already determined from my hotel room the night before the game, I’m jumping on the first FB I see.	Now how awesome would it be to hear each one of their thought processes and work habits?	Nice! Appreciate the thought that went into this. And my wife thinks I’m answering important emails. I love her but there’s only so many chores to do around the house. #burningtime	And there lies my answer- I think. I attended 8 yrs of Catholic school. I’ve said a ton of Our Fathers coming out of confession. In 4th grade I got caught off guard talking to my friend. Unprepared I said Act of Contrition and made up my sins. How bad is that? Lied in confession!	Waiting for you to answer the “Our Father” question. I know it will be good!	I NEED TO KNOW: In the lyrics of PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE, is the correct line “all he left us was a loan” or “all he left us was alone”? Listen to the song before you answer, the whole song. Papa begged, borrowed and stole before he died. I know, I’m out there.	I NEED TO KNOW: When a person wants to describe stopping an action in it’s tracks, is the saying “ nip it in the butt” like a dog biting the mailman, or “ nip it in the bud” like pruning a plant? I’ve been carrying these unknowns in my brain too long. I’m cleaning the attic.	NEED TO KNOW: When describing entering unknown territory a phrase is often used to capture the essence of what’s about to happen. Is the phrase “unchartered waters” or “uncharted waters”? I’ve heard it said both ways by all levels of intellect. Let’s settle this.	I NEED TO KNOW: In the prayer OUR FATHER, the words “I will be done”, what is the usage of the word “will”? Is it being used to say once his kingdom comes he is finished? Or once his kingdom comes his power (will) is to be exalted on earth as it is in heaven?

I pray that Allah Subuhana Watahalah grant the soul of our beloved Mallam Kyari eternal rest and admit him to Aljana Firdaus.	8. We must honor the departed by doing all we can to defeat the virus so that we safeguard the health of the nation that Mallam Kyari loved so deeply. To the family of Mallam Kyari, may Almighty Allah support and comfort them during this painful moment.	7. We know not why Almighty Allah has taken him at this time. Allah's will is supreme and there is no questioning it. Yet we must learn from Mallam Kyari's passing.	6. While we must maintain spatial distance from one another we must yet come closer in the spirit of brotherly compassion and national purpose in order to defeat the threat we now face. “Mallam Kyari was a man of accomplishment.	5. Although we are today made sad, we must also use this moment to strengthen our resolve in fighting the pandemic. Let us rededicate ourselves to obeying the public health measures such as physical distancing so that we may defeat the contagion and not fall to it.	4. This death came at a time the government is working assiduously to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We must not allow the passing away of Mallam Kyari and the other Nigerians who have lost their lives to this terrible disease to be in vain.	3. My deepest condolences go to President Buhari, the people of NIgeria and especially the family of Mallam kyari over this tragic loss. May Almighty Allah comfort the president and the Kyari family at this difficult moment.	2. Whatever someone will try to say about Mallam Kyari, the words will prove insufficient. His influence in government and throughout the land was substantial and profound. He will surely be missed.	1. I'm deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Malam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to the President.

GEJ	He will continue to live in the hearts and minds of his compatriots as Togo's foremost reformist and statesman who helped carve a democratic path for his country. GEJ	I offer my deepest condolences to the Government and people of the Republic of Togo over the death of H.E. Edem Kodjo, former Secretary-General of the @_AfricanUnion and ex-Prime Minister of Togo.	Let us continue to live in faith and walk in love so we can conquer all our national challenges; for the troubles of this time will surely redound unto greater honour and glory for us all. Happy Easter Celebrations. GEJ	We must not allow the challenges of this present time to overwhelm the riches of God's grace and the truth of His love towards us, as nothing can separate us from the love of God.	It has been a season of hardship for some and a moment of fear and despair for others. In all these, we must remain steadfast in faith, boundless in hope and obstinate in love for God and humanity.	These are not the best of times for Nigerians and many others around the world because of the global crisis caused by the outbreak of COVID - 19 pandemic, which has disrupted the fate and fortunes of many.	At Easter, our common testimonies are tales of the triumph of life over death, songs of victory over the devil and celebrations of love, mercy and grace.",880663.0,30.0,29355.43333333333,4214.3,309.0,27034.0,657.3,33.0,4805.0,#Covid_19 #RamadanMubarak #RamadanMubarak,0.3,0.2,35.29524691358,353,3

There are some good points in the replies about air-volume and more warm air entering an empty freezer when opened, but all things being equal, a single ice cube tray of water should freeze faster than five trays put in at once. Though the difference may not be super huge.	This also assumes that the freezer cools the interior at a constant rate. I could imagine a freezer that somehow 'detects' the job ahead and works harder (cools at a faster rate) if there's a large mass of un-frozen stuff inside suddenly.	If the freezer is full and everything inside is already as cold as the freezer gets, there shouldn't be much difference unless perhaps the freezer is so full that air flow is restricted.	The more stuff there is in the freezer that isnt already frozen, the longer it will take for everything in the freezer to freeze. Imagine a cup of water by itself vs a cup of water and a huge pot of hot oil. The oil will warm the space and slow the temp drop for everything inside	2006	These two chain-reaction artists constantly impress me.

Had an experience very similar this morning at Tops.	When I met @TigNotaro at a music festival, we had the same hair style and decided we were doppelgängers.

I hope everyone, especially #TeamPete, will join us in thanking our essential workers and connecting with friends and neighbors to show the true character of this nation.	This pandemic—like climate change—has no respect for borders. These global problems require American leadership, not the opposite.	Holidays now are taking on new meaning, and requiring new ways of honoring old traditions, for people all of faiths. To Muslims around the world marking the start of the holy month, I extend my warmest regards and wish you #RamadanMubarak.	Looking forward to talking with General @StanMcChrystal shortly! Please join us on Instagram.	More than the bluster of our adversaries, it’s the sadness of our allies that shows just how much regard we have lost around the world. It’s not too late for America to restore our leadership role, but it soon will be.	I am so sorry to hear this heartbreaking news. Chasten and I send our deepest condolences from here in South Bend.	The good news is that the people protesting on statehouse lawns represent a small minority relative to the attention they got. The bad news is that someone’s political party affects whether they think we should listen to doctors on how to save lives.	Health care is one more area where the pandemic has laid bare why we cannot, and should not, go back to what we had before.	Muffet McGraw has earned legendary status for her tremendous national impact on college basketball—as well as the deep respect and affection of our local community in South Bend. Thank you for your leadership!	This #EarthDay in particular, we should pause and consider our relationship with nature.

After the release of 'Back To Black' in 2006, Amy's beehive hairdo and bold, winged eyeliner became synonymous with her signature style. Often compared to the style of Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes, the two artists shared a mutual appreciation of each others music and style. 	'In My Bed / You Sent Me Flying', the double A-side second single from Amy's debut, 'Frank' was released 16 years ago this month, April 2004. 	'You'll never get my mind right, like two ships passing in the night...' Amy photographed in London on a promotional day for debut album, 'Frank'.	“When I met Amy, I was doing ‘Made You Look’ for Nas’ album, I was starting to work on Frank, so there are Nas songs where Amy did ad-libs that we never put out. She was really inspired by him.” - @SalaamRemi speaking on Amy &amp; @Nas' musical relationship	Introducing the Amy Winehouse Complete Spotify playlist, an extensive mix of Amy’s hits, deep cuts, collaborations and more. A perfect soundtrack to the long weekend. Stay safe out there https://amywinehouse.lnk.to/Complete	With both tracks being produced by her longtime producer Salaam Remi, Amy's second single 'In My Bed' sampled Nas' single 'Made You Look' Here, Amy is pictured in London. Photo by Indira Cesarine	'She always had something smart to say. You'd want to be like, 'You shouldn't have said that.' But then you've got to laugh because it was so funny. I miss her actually as a person. And musically, she stands up there as one of the best to ever do what she's done.' - @SalaamRemi	Today marks 16 years since the release of Amy’s single ‘In My Bed’. Produced by @salaamremi and sampling @nas’ ‘Made You Look’, the track is one of the biggest singles from Amy’s debut album ‘Frank’.

Before we criticize Mark Appel for shutting it down some need to understand that this game is much more difficult both mentally and physically than most realize. You better be really good if you don’t truly love the game or it will beat you.	Without a doubt... plus 11.7 baseball scholarships to 85 in football doesn’t help.	Roy Halladay was special. Avg 220IP & 19 W's in 10 yr run but never Avg K per IP in any of his 19yrs as a pro. Wins over Strikeouts any day!	Going to HS games & seeing more spring football. 11.7 vs 85 scholarships. NFL does it with 53? Not a mystery why fewer playing baseball.	Kyle Hendricks is 31-17 career, a Cy Young candidate and WS Champ with a FB that ranked 70th of 74 ML starters.

While I sympathise with the Govt as Covid19 has crippled countries globally, failure to evacuate distraught Kenyans overseas, excessive use of force by police & subdued dialogue on the stimulus packages to cushion vulnerable citizens destroys public trust in it's efforts. Adjust!	Good morning, at 7.30am I will be live on @Hot_96Kenya with @KoinangeJeff and @HamoProf. We discuss combating COVID-19, the economical impact of the current pandemic and how the government is handling the situation.	Asking distraught Kenyans in China to pay for their tickets home and COVID-19 tests is unacceptable! We have quarantine centres for that. The government announced that over ksh 1b has been raised for the COVID-19 fund. Surely part of that money can be used to evacuate our people!	I call on all African Nations to wake up and address the Inhumane situations facing Africans in Foreign Countries amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. It's a wake up call. Our investment on priority areas especially Health in Africa is wanting. Last night @TV47KE:	I join my fellow Kenyans who have expressed dismay about the huge predicament of Kenyan citizens living in China, and indeed elsewhere in the world.

1112,jejohnson322,"I’ll see you Saturday 4/25 3&9pm ET and Sunday 4/26 3pm ET on @MSNBC! But first, I could use some feedback... would you help?	No, I got it right. They're not talking about putting a person out in the sun and *poof* they're cured. I'd be highly skeptical if they'd said that! This ONLY refers to saliva droplets on nonporous surfaces. But in a building, in your body... totally different story.	At least 70%. Here's more on those guidelines, from the CDC:	Correct. Summer sun alone won't end the outbreak. If people start crowding the beaches, for example, COVID-19 could come roaring back. But this research shows summer weather is much less hospitable for coronavirus on nonporous surfaces.	DHS has a department that usually researches things like biological weapons. They repurposed that lab to study the virus - that's where these findings come from. FYI, it wasn't the head of Homeland Security: the head of this research department gave the findings.	This is just about coronavirus on nonporous surfaces, not inside people. This study suggests that once summer comes, it'll have fewer public places to linger. Plus, South Florida has lots of A/C and shady spots: easier places for the virus to survive.	GOOD NEWS: new @DHSgov research shows summer weather conditions kill #Coronavirus in saliva in minutes: 70+ degree heat, 80% humidity &amp; direct sunlight. Also, bleach will kill the virus on nonporous surfaces in 5 minutes. Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol kills it in seconds.	“One way or another, the show will go on.” @NYCMayor says @Macys will “definitely” do #4thofJuly fireworks show, adapted for the #COVID19 outbreak: presumably, with no crowds. Details to come. New York has canceled all parade &amp; event permits through at least June.	So, how are you doing? Are you okay?

When Barnhart Transportation made a stop in Fort worth to drop off Gas Monkey Energy for the first responders out there, I made sure to go out there and thank them for everything that they're doing! If anyone is asking, those tire marks aren't from me 	One of my favorite builds and now one of my favorite shirts! Grab one at http://bit.ly/GMGBUILT	Barnhart Transportation and ShipSmith are keeping it movin'! A full truckload of Gas Monkey Energy has made it over to the first responders in Walworth, NY. We still have a ton of stops across the US left before this mission is finished!	Tomorrow I'm sitting down and talking with my friends over at Clasiq. Head over to http://bit.ly/RRR-CLASIQ or their Facebook page at 9:30 am CST tomorrow to listen! Go ahead and set that reminder now	Another epic build in the history books for @GasMonkeyGarage! This was our first build like this and a great change of pace for the garage.

1440,redfern_ian,"The numbers quoted by John Percy today are frightening. A wage deferral just buys time. You're right, there will have to be sales, simply to get costs down & raise cash. Clubs will have us over a barrel on fees too, particularly in a flat market. Fans won't be happy.....	What an awful tragedy. How any person could just drive-off is beyond words. There's has to be someone who knows who did this. Hopefully conscience & social-responsibility bring about the right outcome	It is if you can 'lose' the big earners that are crippling the club. Otherwise, they'll just carry on being a cash drain. No business can keep on paying wages of 1.6xs its income indefinitely. Without gate receipts income will half too, so the wage bill becomes over 3xs income 	It's ridiculous Andy. Derby at about 160% on last accounts. Us, Sheff Wed & Reading (along with Wigan) the 4 worst in the division. No coincidence it's the same ones who sold their stadium to the owner. I genuinely fear Derby will end up in Administration this summer.	It'll end up as a fire-sale Andy. There won't be much cash around for transfers this summer, so the big clubs will have us over a barrel, with rock-bottom take-it or leave-it offers. I expect all of the out of contract players will go too, simply to lose cost off the books.	Even IF the players do agree to defer wages, it's cash that remains due at a later point; when the club records huge losses even in normal times. It just kicks a fundamental cost issue down the road & the arrears arguably make it even worse. I can understand the players' caution	Interesting use of the word 'IF' there Kieran. I assume there's a large dose of sarcasm involved, given that not filing is a criminal offence . All assumes, of course, that they don't go into a formal insolvency process first, which wouldn't hugely surprise me in either case!	Childish. Unprecedented times. You can't please everyone. That's life......and life itself always 'trumps' football.	The silence from the club on all subjects is deafening.......& usually silence is a sign of big problems.	The players are going to have a long wait, if they want details of Derby’s latest financial position; June 2019 accounts are already technically overdue (using CV19 extension).

1555,SenWarren,"I’m proud of the innovative work that Massachusetts & @PIH are doing to set up a contact tracing program to slow the spread of COVID-19. I’ve laid out a plan with @RepAndyLevin for a national contact tracing program &amp; hope to learn from the Commonwealth’s leadership.	It's outrageous that we don't know what secret favors Trump might be getting from @DeutscheBank, or what favors the bank may be getting in return. The American people need to know the President is working for them, not for his personal financial interests.	Hedge funds, private equity firms, & the wealthiest Americans shouldn't be exploiting this crisis for even more tax breaks. I’m glad to join @SenWhitehouse, @SenSherrodBrown, @SenSanders &amp; others on a bill to repeal tax cuts for the rich in the CARES Act.	This is exactly what happens when you let a giant company be both the umpire and a player in the game. @Amazon needs to explain why it misled Congress – and we need to break up Amazon and big tech.	26 million people are unemployed. Frontline workers are wearing garbage bags. But the Pentagon can divert billions to Trump’s racist border wall & nobody blinks an eye. I bet the Pentagon has some money in the couch cushions for masks or tests. Have they tried looking?	Experts at the @NWLC &amp; @CLASP_DC say it will take at least $9.6B a month during this crisis to keep our child care system from collapsing before Americans head back to work. Congress should adopt my plan with @SenTinaSmith for a $50B child care bailout. https://medium.com/@SenWarren/our-plan-for-a-50-billion-child-care-bailout-6d94dde53c77?source=friends_link&amp;sk=8865bca5eeb98f8976104f2126709962	The PPP was created to help devastated small businesses, but banks are playing favorites, serving the wealthy & well-connected first & leaving mom-and-pops behind. @NydiaVelazquez I want the @SBAOIG &amp; @USTreasury OIG to investigate this waste &amp; abuse.	We’re in a public health & economic crisis. Families & small businesses need help. But the @DeptofDefense gave out a $569M contract to a GOP donor to build the President’s monument to hate at the border. @BennieGThompson &amp; I want @DoD_IG to investigate.	A national contact tracing program needs a national @CDCgov strategy, resources for state, local, &amp; tribal health depts, privacy protections for patients, &amp; a strong, diverse workforce to power it. @RepAndyLevin &amp; I look forward to working with Congress to advance this proposal.	Contact tracing is a tool where public health fieldworkers ID infected patients, get in touch with close contacts, and explain what to do to keep safe. The US has used contact tracing to stop the spread of TB and STDs, and other countries have used it to stop COVID-19.",5861945.0,489.0,11987.617586912063,4517.2,659.0,11963.0,1336.7,121.0,4106.0,,0.0,0.8,5.579104938271389,436,2

MM	One of our family of Mozart in the Jungle passed this morning from the corona virus. Mark Blum was a truly wonderful actor, but more importantly, was a funny sensitive, and beautiful man. RIP. - Malcolm	Max was a truly brilliant actor, known mostly for rather serious roles, but in person had a wonderful sense of humor. It was an honor to work with him, RIP . MM	Doris was the mother my generation fantasied about; we all wanted her to be our own mother. She was a total class act and she will be missed, RIP Doris.	20 years ago today we lost this great man. #kubrick	He also helped fellow filmmakers as a producer, he managed the funding of Lindsay Anderson’s If.... and with his partner Michael Medwin also produced Lindsay’s next film O Lucky Man.
