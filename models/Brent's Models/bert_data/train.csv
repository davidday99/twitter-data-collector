I pray that Allah Subuhana Watahalah grant the soul of our beloved Mallam Kyari eternal rest and admit him to Aljana Firdaus.	8. We must honor the departed by doing all we can to defeat the virus so that we safeguard the health of the nation that Mallam Kyari loved so deeply. To the family of Mallam Kyari, may Almighty Allah support and comfort them during this painful moment.	7. We know not why Almighty Allah has taken him at this time. Allah's will is supreme and there is no questioning it. Yet we must learn from Mallam Kyari's passing.	6. While we must maintain spatial distance from one another we must yet come closer in the spirit of brotherly compassion and national purpose in order to defeat the threat we now face. “Mallam Kyari was a man of accomplishment.	5. Although we are today made sad, we must also use this moment to strengthen our resolve in fighting the pandemic. Let us rededicate ourselves to obeying the public health measures such as physical distancing so that we may defeat the contagion and not fall to it.	4. This death came at a time the government is working assiduously to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We must not allow the passing away of Mallam Kyari and the other Nigerians who have lost their lives to this terrible disease to be in vain.	3. My deepest condolences go to President Buhari, the people of NIgeria and especially the family of Mallam kyari over this tragic loss. May Almighty Allah comfort the president and the Kyari family at this difficult moment.	2. Whatever someone will try to say about Mallam Kyari, the words will prove insufficient. His influence in government and throughout the land was substantial and profound. He will surely be missed.	1. I'm deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Malam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to the President. He was an extremely able, loyal and talented man who dedicated his considerable skills to the success of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.	25...at a virtual zero interest rate policy.

1112,"I’ll see you Saturday 4/25 3&9pm ET and Sunday 4/26 3pm ET on @MSNBC! But first, I could use some feedback... would you help?	No, I got it right. They're not talking about putting a person out in the sun and *poof* they're cured. I'd be highly skeptical if they'd said that! This ONLY refers to saliva droplets on nonporous surfaces. But in a building, in your body... totally different story.	At least 70%. Here's more on those guidelines, from the CDC:	Correct. Summer sun alone won't end the outbreak. If people start crowding the beaches, for example, COVID-19 could come roaring back. But this research shows summer weather is much less hospitable for coronavirus on nonporous surfaces.	DHS has a department that usually researches things like biological weapons. They repurposed that lab to study the virus - that's where these findings come from. FYI, it wasn't the head of Homeland Security: the head of this research department gave the findings.	This is just about coronavirus on nonporous surfaces, not inside people. This study suggests that once summer comes, it'll have fewer public places to linger. Plus, South Florida has lots of A/C and shady spots: easier places for the virus to survive.	GOOD NEWS: new @DHSgov research shows summer weather conditions kill #Coronavirus in saliva in minutes: 70+ degree heat, 80% humidity &amp; direct sunlight. Also, bleach will kill the virus on nonporous surfaces in 5 minutes. Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol kills it in seconds.	“One way or another, the show will go on.” @NYCMayor says @Macys will “definitely” do #4thofJuly fireworks show, adapted for the #COVID19 outbreak: presumably, with no crowds. Details to come. New York has canceled all parade &amp; event permits through at least June.	So, how are you doing? Are you okay?	BREAKING: @NYCPride will not take place in June for its 50th anniversary. @NYCMayor Bill de Blaise extends ban on large event permits, adds that the city hopes to reschedule this landmark #LGBTQ Pride event. @PRparadeNYC &amp; @CelebrateIsrael also will not take place in June.",0,1,0,0

Like the rest of the world, we have been watching the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the accompanying uncertainty across the globe.

Read more:	Hello everyone. This may be looking very familiar to you all. While continuing to monitor the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the accompanying global uncertainty, it has become apparent that further tour adjustments need to be made. See more: http://www.brucehornsby.com/news-2/2020/3/18/spring-touring-update	We’re pleased to report all previously postponed An Evening with Bruce Hornsby performances have now been rescheduled. All previously purchased tickets remain vaild. Please contact the venue box office with any questions.	In the absence of live concerts right now we’d like to present three concerts from Colorado from last August, three nights in a row with no song repeats (other than a small snippet of “Cast-Off” during “White-Wheeled Limousine” on the last night).

There won't be much cash around for transfers this summer, so the big clubs will have us over a barrel, with rock-bottom take-it or leave-it offers. I expect all of the out of contract players will go too, simply to lose cost off the books.	Even IF the players do agree to defer wages, it's cash that remains due at a later point; when the club records huge losses even in normal times. It just kicks a fundamental cost issue down the road & the arrears arguably make it even worse. I can understand the players' caution	Interesting use of the word 'IF' there Kieran. I assume there's a large dose of sarcasm involved, given that not filing is a criminal offence . All assumes, of course, that they don't go into a formal insolvency process first, which wouldn't hugely surprise me in either case!	Childish. Unprecedented times. You can't please everyone. That's life......and life itself always 'trumps' football.	The silence from the club on all subjects is deafening.......& usually silence is a sign of big problems.	The players are going to have a long wait, if they want details of Derby’s latest financial position; June 2019 accounts are already technically overdue (using CV19 extension). However, it’s not difficult to work out that the club is in dire straits.",0,0,0,1

While I sympathise with the Govt as Covid19 has crippled countries globally, failure to evacuate distraught Kenyans overseas, excessive use of force by police & subdued dialogue on the stimulus packages to cushion vulnerable citizens destroys public trust in it's efforts. Adjust!	Good morning, at 7.30am I will be live on @Hot_96Kenya with @KoinangeJeff and @HamoProf. We discuss combating COVID-19, the economical impact of the current pandemic and how the government is handling the situation.	Asking distraught Kenyans in China to pay for their tickets home and COVID-19 tests is unacceptable! We have quarantine centres for that. The government announced that over ksh 1b has been raised for the COVID-19 fund. Surely part of that money can be used to evacuate our people!	I call on all African Nations to wake up and address the Inhumane situations facing Africans in Foreign Countries amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. It's a wake up call. Our investment on priority areas especially Health in Africa is wanting. Last night @TV47KE:	I join my fellow Kenyans who have expressed dismay about the huge predicament of Kenyan citizens living in China, and indeed elsewhere in the world. This is an imperative that the government must address with all the urgency it deserves.

Jinja erupts in celebration after RDC Eric Sakwa is arrested, charged in court & sent to jail! Overzealous & brutal in enforcing his “master’s will” NOT serving Ugandans as by law established. Reminds me of very many before him, some on the run, in jail or dead! Time comes...	Large-scale land-grabbing is always with knowledge &support of powerful Uganda “Mafia”. Abid Alam’s luck run out when he (seems unknowingly) touched the Mafia’s anus! Then, orders for his arrest came directly fm State House. Without doubt, it’ll be sorted!	We should have testing centres at all official border crossing, preferably in the District Hospitals. Drivers would have to wait for about 4hrs (max) only to get results. Testing from Entebbe alone is undesirable & untenable!",0,0,0,1

If a pitcher had a late breaking tight slider I already determined from my hotel room the night before the game, I’m jumping on the first FB I see.

I love her but there’s only so many chores to do around the house. #burningtime	And there lies my answer- I think. I attended 8 yrs of Catholic school. I’ve said a ton of Our Fathers coming out of confession. In 4th grade I got caught off guard talking to my friend. Unprepared I said Act of Contrition and made up my sins. How bad is that? Lied in confession!	Waiting for you to answer the “Our Father” question. I know it will be good!	I NEED TO KNOW: In the lyrics of PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE, is the correct line “all he left us was a loan” or “all he left us was alone”? Listen to the song before you answer, the whole song. Papa begged, borrowed and stole before he died. I know, I’m out there.	I NEED TO KNOW: When a person wants to describe stopping an action in it’s tracks, is the saying “ nip it in the butt” like a dog biting the mailman, or “ nip it in the bud” like pruning a plant? I’ve been carrying these unknowns in my brain too long. I’m cleaning the attic.	NEED TO KNOW: When describing entering unknown territory a phrase is often used to capture the essence of what’s about to happen. Is the phrase “unchartered waters” or “uncharted waters”? I’ve heard it said both ways by all levels of intellect. Let’s settle this.	I NEED TO KNOW: In the prayer OUR FATHER, the words “I will be done”, what is the usage of the word “will”? Is it being used to say once his kingdom comes he is finished? Or once his kingdom comes his power (will) is to be exalted on earth as it is in heaven?

This pandemic—like climate change—has no respect for borders. These global problems require American leadership, not the opposite.	Holidays now are taking on new meaning, and requiring new ways of honoring old traditions, for people all of faiths. To Muslims around the world marking the start of the holy month, I extend my warmest regards and wish you #RamadanMubarak.	Looking forward to talking with General @StanMcChrystal shortly! Please join us on Instagram.	More than the bluster of our adversaries, it’s the sadness of our allies that shows just how much regard we have lost around the world. It’s not too late for America to restore our leadership role, but it soon will be.	I am so sorry to hear this heartbreaking news. Chasten and I send our deepest condolences from here in South Bend.	The good news is that the people protesting on statehouse lawns represent a small minority relative to the attention they got. The bad news is that someone’s political party affects whether they think we should listen to doctors on how to save lives.	Health care is one more area where the pandemic has laid bare why we cannot, and should not, go back to what we had before.	Muffet McGraw has earned legendary status for her tremendous national impact on college basketball—as well as the deep respect and affection of our local community in South Bend. Thank you for your leadership!	This #EarthDay in particular, we should pause and consider our relationship with nature.

However, he couldn’t give up now. “Lead the way...I guess.”	I swear that when I give comforting and kind words to Thomas sometimes, it becomes a freaking paragraph. I can’t help it. 	Brandon suddenly had second thoughts about asking SamSam and decided to hold back. “I...guess.” Her danger aura was more terrifying this time round...and the brunette didn’t like it one bit.	“I won’t. SamSam...is okay. I...like her.” Brandon gave a soft smile as he headed back downstairs to Sav, ready to train with SamSam. He was anxious about asking SamSam for advice but if she really was good at confidence boosting...he wanted to try.	It’s okay because with some videos, you don’t realise how long they actually are until you edit and see for yourself. However, your long videos are what make your channel so great Thomas and you always work hard, maybe too hard sometimes. I’m glad you take breaks though, Ily.	“Hm.” Damon let out a minor chuckle before smiling at Virgil. He really did love him, with his whole supposedly ‘cold’ heart. “I’m glad to hear that.”	“That doesn’t surprise me.” Brandon then let out a find chuckle with a smile. He needed to train with SamSam next anyway to learn how to use his talisman.	“I don’t have the guts to do that.” The anxious male sighed and fixed his gaze down to the floor sorrowfully.",1,0,0,0

Amy photographed in London on a promotional day for debut album, 'Frank'.	“When I met Amy, I was doing ‘Made You Look’ for Nas’ album, I was starting to work on Frank, so there are Nas songs where Amy did ad-libs that we never put out. She was really inspired by him.” - @SalaamRemi speaking on Amy &amp; @Nas' musical relationship	Introducing the Amy Winehouse Complete Spotify playlist, an extensive mix of Amy’s hits, deep cuts, collaborations and more. A perfect soundtrack to the long weekend. Stay safe out there https://amywinehouse.lnk.to/Complete	With both tracks being produced by her longtime producer Salaam Remi, Amy's second single 'In My Bed' sampled Nas' single 'Made You Look' Here, Amy is pictured in London. Photo by Indira Cesarine	'She always had something smart to say. You'd want to be like, 'You shouldn't have said that.' But then you've got to laugh because it was so funny. I miss her actually as a person. And musically, she stands up there as one of the best to ever do what she's done.' - @SalaamRemi	Today marks 16 years since the release of Amy’s single ‘In My Bed’. Produced by @salaamremi and sampling @nas’ ‘Made You Look’, the track is one of the biggest singles from Amy’s debut album ‘Frank’.

So it was a pleasure for Dr. @Chikwe_I and I to participate in a Google Hangout organized by this team of young men &amp; women.

As we rise above the challenges thrown up by the Coronavirus pandemic, we are grateful for the young Nigerians developing and contributing innovative tech solutions to confront #Covid19.	Dolapo and I express our sympathies to the President, Mrs Kulu Kyari, the children, and members of the family on the passing of Mallam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to the President. May the Lord comfort and be with you all in Jesus name, amen.	On the cross, Jesus took on the punishment and shame for all our sins. Today, we honour his sacrifice and recognize the power made available through his resurrection. Happy Easter everyone! Nigeria will prevail.	There are many concerns associated with the lockdown. We are concerned about how the economy will remain stable, how jobs can be protected and ways to create new jobs where possible. We believe that together, Nigeria will prevail!	Many of our citizens are daily wage workers and the President has expressed concerns about this. We are now thinking of ways to provide succour for the period they are unable to work.	I met with President @Mbuhari today to update him on the progress of the Economic Sustainability Committee which he directed me to chair. We have held a number of meetings and are receiving sectoral suggestions on how to position the Nigerian economy post COVID-19.	This afternoon, I chaired the NEC Special Committee on COVID-19.

407,"Happy 4/19.9̅	I miss you too.	There are some good points in the replies about air-volume and more warm air entering an empty freezer when opened, but all things being equal, a single ice cube tray of water should freeze faster than five trays put in at once. Though the difference may not be super huge.	This also assumes that the freezer cools the interior at a constant rate. I could imagine a freezer that somehow 'detects' the job ahead and works harder (cools at a faster rate) if there's a large mass of un-frozen stuff inside suddenly.	If the freezer is full and everything inside is already as cold as the freezer gets, there shouldn't be much difference unless perhaps the freezer is so full that air flow is restricted.	The more stuff there is in the freezer that isnt already frozen, the longer it will take for everything in the freezer to freeze. Imagine a cup of water by itself vs a cup of water and a huge pot of hot oil. The oil will warm the space and slow the temp drop for everything inside	2006	These two chain-reaction artists constantly impress me.

And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.	This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all.	If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs.	While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late.	We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level.	Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.)	Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other––as neighbors and as citizens.	When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time.	Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises.	For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at http://JoeBiden.com.

1555,"I’m proud of the innovative work that Massachusetts & @PIH are doing to set up a contact tracing program to slow the spread of COVID-19. I’ve laid out a plan with @RepAndyLevin for a national contact tracing program &amp; hope to learn from the Commonwealth’s leadership.	It's outrageous that we don't know what secret favors Trump might be getting from @DeutscheBank, or what favors the bank may be getting in return. The American people need to know the President is working for them, not for his personal financial interests.	Hedge funds, private equity firms, & the wealthiest Americans shouldn't be exploiting this crisis for even more tax breaks. I’m glad to join @SenWhitehouse, @SenSherrodBrown, @SenSanders &amp; others on a bill to repeal tax cuts for the rich in the CARES Act.	This is exactly what happens when you let a giant company be both the umpire and a player in the game. @Amazon needs to explain why it misled Congress – and we need to break up Amazon and big tech.	26 million people are unemployed. Frontline workers are wearing garbage bags. But the Pentagon can divert billions to Trump’s racist border wall & nobody blinks an eye. I bet the Pentagon has some money in the couch cushions for masks or tests. Have they tried looking?	Experts at the @NWLC &amp; @CLASP_DC say it will take at least $9.6B a month during this crisis to keep our child care system from collapsing before Americans head back to work. Congress should adopt my plan with @SenTinaSmith for a $50B child care bailout. https://medium.com/@SenWarren/our-plan-for-a-50-billion-child-care-bailout-6d94dde53c77?source=friends_link&amp;sk=8865bca5eeb98f8976104f2126709962	The PPP was created to help devastated small businesses, but banks are playing favorites, serving the wealthy & well-connected first & leaving mom-and-pops behind. @NydiaVelazquez I want the @SBAOIG &amp; @USTreasury OIG to investigate this waste &amp; abuse.	We’re in a public health & economic crisis. Families & small businesses need help. But the @DeptofDefense gave out a $569M contract to a GOP donor to build the President’s monument to hate at the border. @BennieGThompson &amp; I want @DoD_IG to investigate.	A national contact tracing program needs a national @CDCgov strategy, resources for state, local, &amp; tribal health depts, privacy protections for patients, &amp; a strong, diverse workforce to power it. @RepAndyLevin &amp; I look forward to working with Congress to advance this proposal.	Contact tracing is a tool where public health fieldworkers ID infected patients, get in touch with close contacts, and explain what to do to keep safe. The US has used contact tracing to stop the spread of TB and STDs, and other countries have used it to stop COVID-19.",0,0,1,0

I hope you’ll tune in today at 12PM ET as I read ""The Gruffalo"" on @PBSKIDS's YouTube channel and Facebook page!	We can still make a difference even as we #StayHome.
