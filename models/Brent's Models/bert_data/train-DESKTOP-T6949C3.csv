After the release of 'Back To Black' in 2006, Amy's beehive hairdo and bold, winged eyeliner became synonymous with her signature style. Often compared to the style of Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes, the two artists shared a mutual appreciation of each others music and style. 	'In My Bed / You Sent Me Flying', the double A-side second single from Amy's debut, 'Frank' was released 16 years ago this month, April 2004. 	'You'll never get my mind right, like two ships passing in the night...' Amy photographed in London on a promotional day for debut album, 'Frank'.	“When I met Amy, I was doing ‘Made You Look’ for Nas’ album, I was starting to work on Frank, so there are Nas songs where Amy did ad-libs that we never put out.

And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.	This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all.	If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs.	While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late.	We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level.	Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.)	Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other––as neighbors and as citizens.

Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises.

While I sympathise with the Govt as Covid19 has crippled countries globally, failure to evacuate distraught Kenyans overseas, excessive use of force by police & subdued dialogue on the stimulus packages to cushion vulnerable citizens destroys public trust in it's efforts. Adjust!	Good morning, at 7.30am I will be live on @Hot_96Kenya with @KoinangeJeff and @HamoProf. We discuss combating COVID-19, the economical impact of the current pandemic and how the government is handling the situation.	Asking distraught Kenyans in China to pay for their tickets home and COVID-19 tests is unacceptable! We have quarantine centres for that. The government announced that over ksh 1b has been raised for the COVID-19 fund. Surely part of that money can be used to evacuate our people!	I call on all African Nations to wake up and address the Inhumane situations facing Africans in Foreign Countries amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. It's a wake up call. Our investment on priority areas especially Health in Africa is wanting. Last night @TV47KE:	I join my fellow Kenyans who have expressed dismay about the huge predicament of Kenyan citizens living in China, and indeed elsewhere in the world. This is an imperative that the government must address with all the urgency it deserves.

You better be really good if you don’t truly love the game or it will beat you.	Without a doubt... plus 11.7 baseball scholarships to 85 in football doesn’t help.	Roy Halladay was special. Avg 220IP & 19 W's in 10 yr run but never Avg K per IP in any of his 19yrs as a pro. Wins over Strikeouts any day!	Going to HS games & seeing more spring football. 11.7 vs 85 scholarships. NFL does it with 53? Not a mystery why fewer playing baseball.	Kyle Hendricks is 31-17 career, a Cy Young candidate and WS Champ with a FB that ranked 70th of 74 ML starters.

But in a building, in your body... totally different story.	At least 70%. Here's more on those guidelines, from the CDC:	Correct. Summer sun alone won't end the outbreak. If people start crowding the beaches, for example, COVID-19 could come roaring back. But this research shows summer weather is much less hospitable for coronavirus on nonporous surfaces.	DHS has a department that usually researches things like biological weapons. They repurposed that lab to study the virus - that's where these findings come from. FYI, it wasn't the head of Homeland Security: the head of this research department gave the findings.	This is just about coronavirus on nonporous surfaces, not inside people. This study suggests that once summer comes, it'll have fewer public places to linger. Plus, South Florida has lots of A/C and shady spots: easier places for the virus to survive.	GOOD NEWS: new @DHSgov research shows summer weather conditions kill #Coronavirus in saliva in minutes: 70+ degree heat, 80% humidity &amp; direct sunlight. Also, bleach will kill the virus on nonporous surfaces in 5 minutes. Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol kills it in seconds.	“One way or another, the show will go on.” @NYCMayor says @Macys will “definitely” do #4thofJuly fireworks show, adapted for the #COVID19 outbreak: presumably, with no crowds. Details to come. New York has canceled all parade &amp; event permits through at least June.	So, how are you doing? Are you okay?	BREAKING: @NYCPride will not take place in June for its 50th anniversary. @NYCMayor Bill de Blaise extends ban on large event permits, adds that the city hopes to reschedule this landmark #LGBTQ Pride event. @PRparadeNYC &amp; @CelebrateIsrael also will not take place in June.",0,1,0,0

I NEED TO KNOW: In the lyrics of PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE, is the correct line “all he left us was a loan” or “all he left us was alone”? Listen to the song before you answer, the whole song. Papa begged, borrowed and stole before he died. I know, I’m out there.	I NEED TO KNOW: When a person wants to describe stopping an action in it’s tracks, is the saying “ nip it in the butt” like a dog biting the mailman, or “ nip it in the bud” like pruning a plant? I’ve been carrying these unknowns in my brain too long. I’m cleaning the attic.	NEED TO KNOW: When describing entering unknown territory a phrase is often used to capture the essence of what’s about to happen. Is the phrase “unchartered waters” or “uncharted waters”? I’ve heard it said both ways by all levels of intellect. Let’s settle this.	I NEED TO KNOW: In the prayer OUR FATHER, the words “I will be done”, what is the usage of the word “will”? Is it being used to say once his kingdom comes he is finished? Or once his kingdom comes his power (will) is to be exalted on earth as it is in heaven?	Ok, I need some help today solving some of my unsolved issues in my life. Just weird stuff that bothers me. Don’t laugh at me for being so damn analytical.

1440,"The numbers quoted by John Percy today are frightening. A wage deferral just buys time. You're right, there will have to be sales, simply to get costs down & raise cash. Clubs will have us over a barrel on fees too, particularly in a flat market. Fans won't be happy.....	What an awful tragedy. How any person could just drive-off is beyond words. There's has to be someone who knows who did this. Hopefully conscience & social-responsibility bring about the right outcome	It is if you can 'lose' the big earners that are crippling the club. Otherwise, they'll just carry on being a cash drain. No business can keep on paying wages of 1.6xs its income indefinitely. Without gate receipts income will half too, so the wage bill becomes over 3xs income 	It's ridiculous Andy. Derby at about 160% on last accounts. Us, Sheff Wed & Reading (along with Wigan) the 4 worst in the division. No coincidence it's the same ones who sold their stadium to the owner. I genuinely fear Derby will end up in Administration this summer.	It'll end up as a fire-sale Andy. There won't be much cash around for transfers this summer, so the big clubs will have us over a barrel, with rock-bottom take-it or leave-it offers. I expect all of the out of contract players will go too, simply to lose cost off the books.	Even IF the players do agree to defer wages, it's cash that remains due at a later point; when the club records huge losses even in normal times. It just kicks a fundamental cost issue down the road & the arrears arguably make it even worse. I can understand the players' caution	Interesting use of the word 'IF' there Kieran. I assume there's a large dose of sarcasm involved, given that not filing is a criminal offence . All assumes, of course, that they don't go into a formal insolvency process first, which wouldn't hugely surprise me in either case!	Childish. Unprecedented times. You can't please everyone. That's life......and life itself always 'trumps' football.	The silence from the club on all subjects is deafening.......& usually silence is a sign of big problems.	The players are going to have a long wait, if they want details of Derby’s latest financial position; June 2019 accounts are already technically overdue (using CV19 extension).

I’ve laid out a plan with @RepAndyLevin for a national contact tracing program &amp; hope to learn from the Commonwealth’s leadership.	It's outrageous that we don't know what secret favors Trump might be getting from @DeutscheBank, or what favors the bank may be getting in return. The American people need to know the President is working for them, not for his personal financial interests.	Hedge funds, private equity firms, & the wealthiest Americans shouldn't be exploiting this crisis for even more tax breaks. I’m glad to join @SenWhitehouse, @SenSherrodBrown, @SenSanders &amp; others on a bill to repeal tax cuts for the rich in the CARES Act.	This is exactly what happens when you let a giant company be both the umpire and a player in the game. @Amazon needs to explain why it misled Congress – and we need to break up Amazon and big tech.	26 million people are unemployed. Frontline workers are wearing garbage bags. But the Pentagon can divert billions to Trump’s racist border wall & nobody blinks an eye. I bet the Pentagon has some money in the couch cushions for masks or tests. Have they tried looking?	Experts at the @NWLC &amp; @CLASP_DC say it will take at least $9.6B a month during this crisis to keep our child care system from collapsing before Americans head back to work. Congress should adopt my plan with @SenTinaSmith for a $50B child care bailout. https://medium.com/@SenWarren/our-plan-for-a-50-billion-child-care-bailout-6d94dde53c77?source=friends_link&amp;sk=8865bca5eeb98f8976104f2126709962	The PPP was created to help devastated small businesses, but banks are playing favorites, serving the wealthy & well-connected first & leaving mom-and-pops behind. @NydiaVelazquez I want the @SBAOIG &amp; @USTreasury OIG to investigate this waste &amp; abuse.	We’re in a public health & economic crisis. Families & small businesses need help. But the @DeptofDefense gave out a $569M contract to a GOP donor to build the President’s monument to hate at the border. @BennieGThompson &amp; I want @DoD_IG to investigate.	A national contact tracing program needs a national @CDCgov strategy, resources for state, local, &amp; tribal health depts, privacy protections for patients, &amp; a strong, diverse workforce to power it. @RepAndyLevin &amp; I look forward to working with Congress to advance this proposal.	Contact tracing is a tool where public health fieldworkers ID infected patients, get in touch with close contacts, and explain what to do to keep safe. The US has used contact tracing to stop the spread of TB and STDs, and other countries have used it to stop COVID-19.",0,0,1,0

407,"Happy 4/19.9̅	I miss you too.	There are some good points in the replies about air-volume and more warm air entering an empty freezer when opened, but all things being equal, a single ice cube tray of water should freeze faster than five trays put in at once. Though the difference may not be super huge.	This also assumes that the freezer cools the interior at a constant rate. I could imagine a freezer that somehow 'detects' the job ahead and works harder (cools at a faster rate) if there's a large mass of un-frozen stuff inside suddenly.	If the freezer is full and everything inside is already as cold as the freezer gets, there shouldn't be much difference unless perhaps the freezer is so full that air flow is restricted.	The more stuff there is in the freezer that isnt already frozen, the longer it will take for everything in the freezer to freeze. Imagine a cup of water by itself vs a cup of water and a huge pot of hot oil. The oil will warm the space and slow the temp drop for everything inside	2006	These two chain-reaction artists constantly impress me.

Allah's will is supreme and there is no questioning it. Yet we must learn from Mallam Kyari's passing.	6.
