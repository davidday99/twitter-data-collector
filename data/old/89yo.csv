DorothyEubank16,Happy 89th Birthday Sonny Rollins! 
runningparks,Happy 89th Birthday for yesterday Sonny! It’s a pity you can’t play your saxophone anymore. I loved your performance at Ronnie Scott’s way back in July 1974. Excellent show! Was really blown away by it.
Gimms,I cried twice yesterday and both times it was due to my Nanna being spoken about. 18 years and it doesn't get any easier. We all miss and love you so much and knew you were right there with us - Happy 89th Birthday.
