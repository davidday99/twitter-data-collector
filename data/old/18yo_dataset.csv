18,MarkLabbett,"Nice try, clearly not him :)","Exact opposite bud, reports suggest young people are both more resistant and less infectious. Though as with much about this terrible disease that could change","Fair point, well made. Problem is we are all at some risk of infection 24/7, it is a question of how much risk and when. What happens when the paycheques stop?",So the alternative is?,Could you expand on outdated economic model please?,To borrow Napoleons dictum - is it better to be a lucky president than a good one?,Donald Trump may well be the worst US president in history but if he ends the US lockdown at the right time and saves the US/World economy.... or he could kill a million Americans unnecessarily. It all depends on actual mortality rate,"At some point, probably after the next general election, there will be a “corona budget” where taxes go up and public services go down :(",Cannot dispute this. The problem will be exacerbated if business tax revenues shrink significantly because of the economic contraction,"A phased relaxation starting soon I hope. Stats suggest that under 30s have v low mortality rate, it comes down to how infectious they are likely to be"

18,mermhart,In other news.... In the front garden a wasp nearly went up my front garden. Thank you. As you were.,Oh it’s boringly simple!!! But fun. Thanks. I got confused with the scores going on.,Please can you explain to us idiots (not me obviously) how this virtual / fantasy tennis thing works....,Ok this is the first response I saw for the #trainofkindness (see previous tweet) DM your sisters address. Tell her to build it and send me a video on here / via you and then she can send it to someone. We can follow the trains journey and feel more like we are in this together!,SUCH FUN IDEA - I’m going to post my Lego train to someone who replies who needs it if they can’t afford things to relax and distract. Once you have built it send me a video of where you are and why it helped and send or give it on. Let’s see where it ends up! #trainofkindness,Not at all no. It’s not up to me what the BBC put on air. I am surprised and as horrified as you they ever asked me in the first place! We all make our living in different ways. I am just a human like you. Love to you. Take care.,I continue to be astonished by the vitriol that still happens on twitter right now. I am ok with being misunderstood or not liked (it comes with the job) but that even at this time in our social history it’s happening I just find sad. Luckily love and kindness out lasts all. ,"We don’t get paid (and anything paid I am doing at the moment is going to charity). We get asked by the BBC if we would do the favour as they think it may help a sense of community spirit & kindness. That we ALL need right now. I hope u r ok, well & safe xxx",Never stop playing. It flies in the face of all that’s wrong. #suchfun https://www.instagram.com/p/B-wpdhql8LM/?igshid=1t3otppj7yk94,. @atptour There is the perfect sport for the players during this time. @touchtennis I have no agenda here except having seen videos of players against a wall or using sofas as nets. And touchtennis solves that so they can actually play. Please tell the players.

18,BarbraStreisand,Happy belated b’day Kenny. So glad to hear you and your family have recovered. @KennyEdmonds,Israel ahead on #coronavirus,Trump is trying to blame Governors for lack of testing when the only way to really reopen the country is widespread testing like Germany and South Korea has done.,What a difference.,,"My first leading man, on my first movie. I loved working with you Omar. You would have been 88 today. ",,Where are the tests? Trump said the country should open up without widespread testing. The US now has more recorded cases and more deaths than any nation in the world. Does he not want Americans to know the real numbers?,Donald Trump has so mismanaged the testing for coronavirus and the critical supply of ventilators and protective equipment that a real manager who tells the truth is desperately needed.,"When Trump speaks at his daily briefings, the amount of misinformation is staggering. He is treating the press briefings as a television ratings game he can brag about on Twitter."
